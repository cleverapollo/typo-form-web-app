      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Thanks for using Informed 365’s products, services, websites, and apps which are branded as “Informed 365”.
      These Terms of Use contain the terms under which Informed 365 and its licensors (i.e. typically the entities for whom we gather data) provide their Services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used. 
      Informed 365 provides a variety of different services. Additional service-specific terms and policies (including rules and guidelines) apply to some Services (“Additional Terms”). Those Additional Terms become a part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. 
      You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services.
      If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p>
      <h2>1. Privacy</h2>
      <h3>1.1. Privacy.</h3>
      <p>In the course of using the Services, you may submit content to Informed 365 (including your personal data and the personal data of others) or third parties may submit content to you through the Services (all of the above will be referred to as your “Content”). We know that by giving us your Content, you are trusting us to treat it appropriately. Informed 365’s Privacy Policy details how we treat your Content (including your personal data) and we agree to adhere to those Informed 365 privacy policies. You in turn agree that Informed 365 may use and share your Content in accordance with the Informed 365 privacy policies and applicable data protection laws. </p>
      <h3>1.2. Confidentiality.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and disclose it in accordance with these Terms. However, your Content is not regarded as confidential information if such Content: (a) is or becomes public (other than through breach of these Terms by Informed 365); (b) was lawfully known to Informed 365 before receiving it from you; (c) is received by Informed 365 from a third party without knowledge of breach of any obligation owed to you; or (d) was independently developed by Informed 365 without reference to your Content. Informed 365 may disclose your Content when required by law or legal process, but only after Informed 365, if permitted by law, uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify you to give you the opportunity to challenge the requirement to disclose.</p>
      <h3>1.3. Security.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 will store and process your Content in a manner consistent with industry security standards. Informed 365 has implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to help ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of your Content and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of your Content.</p>
      <h2>2. Your Content</h2>
      <h3>2.1. You Retain Ownership of Your Content.</h3>
      <p>You retain ownership of all of your intellectual property rights in your Content. Informed 365 does not claim ownership over any of your Content. These Terms do not grant us any licenses or rights to your Content except for the limited rights needed for us to provide the Services, and as otherwise described in these Terms.<p>
      <h3>2.2. Limited License to Your Content.</h3>
      <p>You grant Informed 365 a worldwide, royalty free license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works, make available to Informed 365’s licensor(s) for whom you provided information, and otherwise exploit your Content, but only for the limited purposes of providing the Services to you and as otherwise permitted by the Informed 365 privacy policies. This license for such limited purposes continues even after you stop using our Services, with respect to aggregate and de-identified data derived from your Content and any residual backup copies of your Content made in the ordinary course of Informed 365’s business. This license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you. If you provide Informed 365 with feedback about the Services, we may use your feedback without any obligation to you.</p>
      <h3>2.3. Other IP Claims.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect our users to do the same. If you believe an Informed 365 user is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, please contact us at info@informed365.com. </p>

      <h2>3. Informed 365 IP</h2>
      <h3>3.1. Informed 365 IP.</h3>
      <p>Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services grants you ownership in the Services or the content you access through the Services (other than your Content). These Terms do not grant you any right to use Informed 365’s IP, code, trademarks or other brand elements.</p>
      <h2>4. User Content</h2>
      <h3>4.1. User Content.</h3>
      <p>The Services display content provided by others that is not owned by Informed 365. Such content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. Correspondingly, you are responsible for your own Content and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that Content in connection with the Services. Informed 365 is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your Content, including sharing it publicly. Please do not use content from the Services unless you have first obtained the permission of its owner or are otherwise authorized by law to do so.</p>
      <h3>4.2. Content Review.</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge that, in order to ensure compliance with legal obligations, Informed 365 may be required to review certain content submitted to the Services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. However, Informed 365 otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.</p>
      <h3>4.3. Third Party Resources.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 may publish links in its Services to internet websites maintained by third parties. Informed 365 does not represent that it has reviewed such third-party websites and is not responsible for them or any content appearing on them. Trademarks displayed in conjunction with the Services are the property of their respective owners.</p>
      <h2>5. Account Management</h2>
      <h3>5.1. Keep Your Password Secure.</h3>
      <p>If you have been issued an account by Informed 365 in connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for safeguarding your password and any other credentials used to access that account. You, and not Informed 365, are responsible for any activity occurring in your account (other than activity that Informed 365 is directly responsible for which is not performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account, you should notify Informed 365 immediately. Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.</p>
      <h3>5.2. Keep Your Details Accurate.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 occasionally sends notices to the email address registered with your account. You must keep your email address and, where applicable, your contact details and other details associated with your account current and accurate. Accounts are controlled by the entity whose email address is registered with the account.</p>
      <h3>5.3. Remember to Backup.</h3>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of your Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Informed 365 will not be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, your Content.</p>
      <h2>6. Acceptable Uses</h2>
      <h3>6.1. Legal Compliance.</h3>
      <p>You represent and warrant that you will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your use of the Services.</p>
      <h3>6.2. Your Responsibilities.</h3>
      <p>You are responsible for your conduct, Content, and communications with others while using the Services. You must comply with the following requirements when using the Services:
      (a) You may not purchase, use, or access the Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or for any other competitive purposes.
      (b) You may not misuse our Services by interfering with their normal operation or attempting to access them using a method other than through the interfaces and instructions that we provide.
      (c) You may not circumvent or attempt to circumvent any limitations that Informed 365 imposes on your account.
      (d) Unless authorised by Informed 365 in writing, you may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Informed 365 system or network.
      (e) Unless authorised by Informed 365 in writing, you may not use any manual or automated system or software to extract or scrape data from the websites or other interfaces through which we make our Services available.
      (f) Unless permitted by applicable law, you may not deny others access to, or reverse engineer, the Services, or attempt to do so.
      (g) You may not transmit any viruses, malware, or other types of malicious software, or links to such software, through the Services.
      (h) You may not engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which is usage significantly more than average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability, or functionality of the Services for other users. Informed 365 will endeavour to notify you of any abusive or excessive usage to provide you with an opportunity to reduce such usage to a level acceptable to Informed 365.
      (i) You may not use the Services to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or to commit an unlawful activity.
      (j) Unless authorised by Informed 365 in writing, you may not resell or lease the Services.
      (k) You may not register accounts by “bots” or other automated methods.
      (l) Your Content and use of the Services may not violate our Content Policy.</p>
      <h2>7. Suspension and Termination of Services</h2>
      <h3>7.1. By You.</h3>
      <p>You can terminate your account at any time through your account management page. Such termination will result in the deactivation or disablement of your account and access to it, and the deletion of content you collected through use of the Services. </p>
      <h2>7.2. By Informed 365.</h2>
      <p>Informed 365 may terminate and / or suspend your account in the following instances:
      Contract termination with Licensor for whom your data is being collected; 
      You use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services; 
      You have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after Informed 365 has so notified you in writing; 
      We are investigating suspected misconduct by you. 
      Also, if we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavour to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where Informed 365 may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. Informed 365 will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. Informed 365 has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.</p>
      <h3>7.3. Further Measures.</h3>
      <p>If Informed 365 stops providing the Services to you because you repeatedly or egregiously breach these Terms, Informed 365 may take measures to prevent the further use of the Services by you, including blocking your IP address.</p>
      <h2>8. Changes and Updates</h2>
      <h3>8.1. Changes to Terms.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 may change these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to Services, and to account for new Services or functionality. The most current version will always be posted on the Informed 365 website. If an amendment is material, as determined in Informed 365’s sole discretion, Informed 365 will notify you by email. Notice of amendments may also be posted upon your login to your account. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. In order for certain changes to become effective, applicable law may require Informed 365 to obtain your consent to such changes, or to provide you with sufficient advance notice of them. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.</p>
      <h3>8.2. Changes to Services.</h3>
      <p>Informed 365 constantly changes and improves the Services. Informed 365 may add, alter, or remove functionality from a Service at any time without prior notice. Informed 365 may also limit, suspend, or discontinue a Service at its discretion. If Informed 365 discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. Informed 365 may remove content from the Services at any time in our sole discretion, although we will endeavour to notify you before we do that if it materially impacts you and if practicable under the circumstances.</p>
   
      <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <h3>9.1. Disclaimers.</h3>

      <h3>9.3. Third Party Claims.</h3>
      <p>If you are a business, you will indemnify and hold harmless Informed 365 and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a third-party claim regarding or in connection with your or your end users’ use of the Services or breach of these Terms, to the extent that such liabilities, damages and costs were caused by you or your end users.</p>
